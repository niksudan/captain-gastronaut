A game by [Nik](https://twitter.com/niksudan), [Ben](https://twitter.com/benbenchammer), [Linkronny](https://twitter.com/ronnyegt) and [Sascha](https://twitter.com/sushilul) for the [Jupiter Hadley Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/the-jupiter-hadley-game-jam). Fullscreen is highly recommended!

Control the Captain with the arrow keys, hold the up arrow to charge up your propulsion systems, and release to lift off. Get to the correct control panel before the dangerometer levels reach critical!

We made this using TypeScript, Aseprite and lots of pizza. It was also made in 48 hours!

We're also really sorry for this.
